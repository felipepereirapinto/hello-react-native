<p style="text-align: center">Built in React Native using Expo CLI</p>

## ðŸ”§ Install

Assuming that you have [Node 12 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

### First, install all packages from the npm

```js
npm install
```
<br>

### Then, install the Expo CLI

```js
npm install -g expo-cli
```
<br>

## ðŸš€ Running

Run the Metro Bundler on localhost

```js
expo start
```

You'll be given a QR code in your terminal and/or browser. Scan it with [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US) (Android) or the Camera app (iOS) to see the app in your phone.
